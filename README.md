# Survey: Optimizing Student Teacher Interactions?
The essential purpose of this group project was to optimize the discussion sections for an upper division statistics course at the University of California, Berkeley. In addition, the main goal was to improve the interactions between students and the lecturer in charge. To tackle this task, we were given a data set of survey responses to work with. 

My particular role was to figure out why the students enjoyed playing video games, as well as to discover the proportion of students that liked video games in general. Using the statistical package R, my teammate and I began by restructuring the data string titled Like from a categorical format to a binary one. With this, we were then able to figure out the proportion of students that responded that they liked playing video games. After which, we continued our analysis by running a Logit model in R. We were then able to conclude that students who thought that video games were educational were more inclined to play them. Additionally, we discovered that gender played a big role as well.
